# Brief

# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- view some educational content on a particular topic
- be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

## Example Extensions

- Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
- Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.

## API, Libraries, Resources

- https://leafletjs.com/ Leaflet is an open-source library for rendering maps and map functionality.
